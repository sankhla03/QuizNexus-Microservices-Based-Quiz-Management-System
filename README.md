# 🚀 Quiz Application – Microservices Backend (Spring Boot)

A **backend-only Quiz Application** built using **Spring Boot Microservices**, demonstrating real-world microservices architecture with **Service Discovery**, **API Gateway**, and **inter-service communication**.

This project focuses on **backend system design and API development**, and is designed to be consumed by any frontend or client application.

## 🧩 Microservices Overview

### 🔹 Service Registry (Eureka Server)
- Central service discovery component
- Registers all microservices dynamically
- Enables load balancing and fault tolerance
- Removes hardcoded service URLs

---

### 🔹 API Gateway
- Single entry point for all client requests
- Routes requests dynamically using Eureka
- Enables CORS for browser-based clients
- Simplifies client-side communication

---

### 🔹 Quiz Service
Responsible for managing quiz operations.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Create quizzes dynamically
- Generate unique **Quiz PIN**
- Fetch random questions using Question Service
- Serve questions one-by-one
- Submit responses and calculate results

---

### 🔹 Question Service
Responsible for question management and evaluation.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Store and manage quiz questions
- Fetch random questions by category
- Hide correct answers from clients
- Evaluate responses and return scores

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Backend)

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Eureka Server
- OpenFeign (Inter-service communication)
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- H2 / SQL Database

---

## 🔄 Backend Request Flow

1. Client sends request to **API Gateway**
2. Gateway routes request to the appropriate microservice
3. Services discover each other via **Eureka**
4. Quiz Service communicates with Question Service using **Feign**
5. Database operations handled independently by each service

---

## 🧪 Core API Endpoints

### 📌 Quiz Service
```
POST /quiz/create
GET /quiz/pin/{quizCode}
GET /quiz/{quizId}/question/{index}
POST /quiz/submit/{quizId}
```

### 📌 Question Service
```
GET /question/allQuestions
GET /question/category/{category}
GET /question/generate
POST /question/getQuestions
POST /question/getScore
```

> All APIs are accessed through the **API Gateway**

---

## ▶️ How to Run Backend Services

### Prerequisites

- JDK 25 (LTS)
- PostgreSQL for the quiz and question service databases

Set the `DB_PASSWORD` environment variable to the PostgreSQL password before starting the services. Both the quiz and question services use this variable.

### 1️⃣ Start Services in Order
1. Eureka Server
2. API Gateway
3. Question Service
4. Quiz Service

---

### 2️⃣ Create a Quiz (Admin Operation)

Using **Postman**:

POST http://localhost:8765/quiz-service/quiz/create

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "categoryName": "Java",
  "numQuestions": 5,
  "title": "Java Basics Quiz"
}
The system generates a unique Quiz PIN, which can be used by any client to access the quiz.
```
